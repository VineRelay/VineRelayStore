Migrations
---------------
Migrations are like version control for your database, to make the database at a stable state in your team.

Here are some scenarios where you can find db migrations useful:
- Seeding database with required data for the application to function.
- Add a new attribute e.g. `fullName` to all your user collection that combines both `firstName` and `lastName`.
- Remove/Rename an attribute in one of your collection.
- Seeding new data that are needed for new features to function.
